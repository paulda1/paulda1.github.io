  <p><strong>GSoC GNU Radio Website - the basics.</strong></p>
  <p>This goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive Out-of-Tree (OOT) module for GNU Radio that enables amateur radio enthusiasts to incorporate FT8 and WSPR functionality directly into their applications. Currently, most operators rely on standalone applications like WSJT-X, limiting flexibility and integration possibilities. The proposed solution is to create modular, reusable components for encoding, modulating, demodulating, and decoding FT8/WSPR messages. These components will include: FT8/WSPR Message Encoder: Implementing standard message formats with validation for callsigns, grid locators, and signal reports FT8/WSPR Modulator: Building 8-FSK modulation for FT8 and 4-FSK modulation for WSPR with proper timing and tone spacing FT8/WSPR Demodulator: Creating components to detect signals, handle frequency drift, and extract weak signals from noise FT8/WSPR Message Decoder: Implementing error correction algorithms and partial decode support Integration Components: Developing example flowgraphs, time synchronization, and potentially QSO tracking features This module will allow experimentation with weak signal protocols, enable integration into complex signal processing chains, provide educational value for understanding digital mode implementation, and support development of new applications leveraging these protocolsâ€”ultimately bringing more skilled contributors to the GNU Radio community. </p>
